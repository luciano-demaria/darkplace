      The protagonist stares into a furnace, slams their head against a pane of glass repeatedly, and they wake up (visibly</br>

      writhing on the floor. They depart from the room their body is in, navigating through their hometown, down the street,</br>
      into the forest, onto a train. As the train departs, the screen darkens. Though we never get confirmation, its safe to</br>
      assume that the protagonist died back in that town. We join them on a train ride where they recognize parallels to the</br>

    I recall something Roland Barthes wrote about how insignificant details allow us to gain a feeling of "being there" in whatever is being</br>
    described. I think of movies, television shows, and video games, and how insignificance typically presents itself through images</br>
    rather than text in these mediums. When examining books, however, the writer must rely solely on imagery in written descriptions...</br>
    A hybrid of book and game, a text-based game, relies on imagery in its writing and immense thoughtfulness in its employment of sound.

    No, it's really not! I've barely scratched the surface. Each and every sound in a text-based game has to be designed with the utmost</br>
    attention to detail in mind. This is not to say you can cheap out on sound design in other games, but it's especially important in</br>
    text-based ones due to the lack of visual accompaniment other than text. A video begins to play in my head of a moment of <i>Welcome to</br>
    the Dark Place</i> that seems to embody this idea. We go through a full range of diegetic and non diegetic soundscape to solely diegetic</br>
