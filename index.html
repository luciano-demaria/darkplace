    The final webpage will be a text-based game based on the game "Welcome to the Dark Place" by Zeekerss. I'm currently</br>

    and citations might look like.

    I wake up on the red carpeted floor of a library. There are some shelves ahead of me and an open door</br>
    off to the right. A warm breeze drifts in from behind me, where I notice an open door leading outside.
