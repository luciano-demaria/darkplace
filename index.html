      <h1>'The Dark Place' - A Media-Rich Site</h1>
      <h2>Aesthetic based upon <a href="https://zeekerss.itch.io/">Zeekerss'</a> 'Welcome to the Dark Place'</br>
          Created by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/luciano-demaria-a021692b5/">Luciano DeMaria</a> for UNT's MUAG 4200 (Video Games: Behind the Scenes)</h2>

    <p>Text for the site will eventually go here. It may describe some things about the game itself.</br>
       I intend to separate the page into categories based on the frameworks we learn over the next couple of weeks.
